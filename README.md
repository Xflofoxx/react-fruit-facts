# react-fruit-facts

This is the first of my steps towards [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Goals

Playing
with [react-router-dom](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/docs/getting-started/installation.md)
and understand how to switch between pages.

### Learned

* **React components**: BrowserRouter, Route, Link
* **Usage**:
  * Dynamic link generation to components
  * How to pass url parameters to a component
* **Plus**:
  * Playing with fonts, and colors
  * Playing with fruits :banana:, :apple:, :pineapple:, :watermelon: ...


## CRA and Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with
the `--template typescript` option.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
